## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network** for sequence modeling and prediction. LSTM is a powerful type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that excels in capturing long-term dependencies in time series data.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Uses LSTM for sequence prediction  
✅ Implemented in Jupyter Notebook  
✅ Utilizes TensorFlow & Keras for deep learning  
✅ Optimized for time series forecasting  

## 📂 File Structure
```
📦 LSTM_Project
 ┣ 📜 lstm_project.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook with LSTM implementation
 ┣ 📜 README.md           # Project documentation
 ┗ 📜 requirements.txt    # Dependencies
```

## 🛠️ Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:
```sh
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu3369/Next word Predictor.git
cd Next word Predictor

# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

## 🏃 Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```sh
jupyter notebook lstm_project.ipynb
```
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and test the LSTM model.

## 📊 Results
- The model is designed for time series forecasting.
